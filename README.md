# MiniPyExperiments
MiniPyExperiments: Learn Python concepts by doing - bite-sized projects.

This repository contains four small Python projects aimed at beginners to help them practice and learn basic programming concepts. The projects included are:

1. [Simple Photo Editor](#simple-photo-editor)
2. [Simple Banking Application](#simple-banking-application)
3. [Simple To-Do List Application](#simple-to-do-list-application)
4. [Simple Contact Book](#simple-contact-book)



# Simple Photo Editor

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform basic photo editing operations such as rotating, resizing, and enhancing the image.

## Features
Rotate an image by a specified angle.
Resize an image to specified dimensions.
Enhance the image by adjusting its contrast and converting it to grayscale.

## Learning Outcomes
Understanding of image processing using the PIL library.
Practicing file handling and path manipulation.
Learning to apply various filters and transformations to images.
Implementation

### Implementation
```See the photoEditor.py file into the simple_PhotoEditor directory for the full implementation```



## Simple Banking Application

### Objective
The objective of this project is to simulate basic banking operations such as creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the account balance.

### Features
- Create a new bank account with a unique account number.
- Deposit money into the account.
- Withdraw money from the account, with a warning if the balance falls below a minimum threshold.
- Check the current balance.

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes and objects.
- Implementation of basic control flow statements (if-else, while loops).
- Handling user input and performing basic validation.
- Simulating real-world banking operations programmatically.

### Implementation
```See the banking.py file into the simple_bankinApp directory for the full implementation```


# Simple To-Do List Application

## Objective
The objective of this project is to manage a to-do list by allowing users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks.

## Features
- Add tasks to the to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from the to-do list.
- View all tasks along with their completion status.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practicing list manipulation and dictionary operations in Python.

- Improving skills in handling user input and displaying information.

## Implementation
```See the TODO.py file into the simple_TODOApp directory for the full implementation```



# Simple Contact Book

## Objective
The objective of this project is to manage a contact book by allowing users to add contacts, view contact details, and delete contacts.

## Features
Add contacts with name, phone number, and email address.
View details of a specific contact.
Delete a contact from the contact book.
View all contacts in the contact book.

## Learning Outcomes
Deepening understanding of dictionary operations in Python.
Practicing data management and retrieval techniques.
